                What we learned
            </h2>
                    <p>Our main objective throughout this school year was memorizing the syntaxes in order to be well prepared for the WebXam. We did this by learning more advanced html and css 
                    as well as a bit of javascript. We learned how a simple code is structured and the three types of css, which are, inline, internal, and external.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Triumphs.</h2>

                <p>
                    Challenges we faecd throughout the school year was with difficult codes, and 
                    the codeathon. During the codeathon we worked hard and learned more
                    programming unfortunately we didn't place in the top 5, but that didn't deter us.
                    After the codeathon we put in more work and effort in order to succeed in other areas.
                    For example, I passed the SAT, WebXam, and accepted to the questbridge program.
