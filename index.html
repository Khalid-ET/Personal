            I'm a Somalian student from Horizon Science Academy Columbus Highschool. I enjoy subjects such as engineering and programming.
            I'm passionate about my academics and I'm always striving to create a successful
            and better future for myself. My website is meant to show everything I've learned in programming throughout my
            3-year Highschool journey. I'll also be talking about my favorite classes, teachers, and people who helped me 
            succeed.
