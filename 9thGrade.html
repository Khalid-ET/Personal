            My Favorite Subjects
        </h2>
        
        <p>My favorite subjects in 9th Grade were U.S History, English 2, and Physical Science.
            These are my favorites because they helped me learn the most, and the teachers always made 
            and effort to help the students who were behind.

            Favorite Teachers
        </h2>

        <p>
            My favorite teachers in 9th Grade were Ms. Meydan and Mr. Jordan. These are my favorite teachers
            because they were the most passionate about their subjects. Furthermore, they always tried to help their students, as well as making the learning 
            experience enjoyable and informative at the same time.

        <h2>Favorite Moments</h2>

        <p> My favorite parts of 9th grade was when were learning about 
            rocketry, physics, and engineering. We learned all this so we would have the proper 
            knowledge when were building and launching rockets. We got to meet a specialist who taught us
            about the formulas and equipment needed to be safe while launching and making the rockets.
