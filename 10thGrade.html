        <h2>First Introduction to Programming.</h2>
        
 <p>10th Grade programming was my first introduction to programming and
            programming software. During this year, we learned basic HTML and CSS and made all of our projects on
            Replit. We also learned project management and everything needed to track and work on a project. We didn't learn
            anything too advanced or difficult, but we practiced everything we learned consistently in order to prepare
            for the WebXam.

<h2>
    What we learned:
</h2>

<p>
    In 10th Grade we learned basic html, css, and how information travels across the 
    internet.  Information on the internet travels as digital data, known as bits which is broken down 
    into small packets and transmitted over networks using protocols like TCP/IP.
