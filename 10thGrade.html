        <h2>First Introduction to Programming.</h2>
        
 <p>10th Grade programming was my first introduction to programming and
            programming software. During this year, we learned basic HTML and CSS and made all of our projects on
            Replit. We also learned project management and everything needed to track and work on a project. We didn't learn
            anything too advanced or difficult, but we practiced everything we learned consistently in order to prepare
            for the WebXam.

<h2>
    What we learned:
</h2>

<p>
    In 10th Grade we learned basic html, css, and how information travels across the 
    internet.  Information on the internet travels as digital data, known as bits which is broken down 
    into small packets and transmitted over networks using protocols like TCP/IP.
    We also learned variables, basic control structures, data structures, object-oriented 
    programming, troubleshooting and debugging, and various programming tools
    We used a website that let us practice and learn all about programming and 
    and technology.

<h2>
    Challenges and Triumphs
</h2>
        <p>
            Challenges I faced during this year was being relatively new to programming and being placed into a 
            class that had already progressed and learned most this material. So, I was put into a situation where I had
            to work extra hard in order to both learn and catch up with the rest of the class. This challenge let me grow
            more compared to what I first believed. Furthermore, I was selected to compete in the codeathon so I had to
            keep working and helping my team. These challenges helped me grow and learn more about my strengths and weaknesses.
